                <strong>1898</strong> -  His father, Motilal Nehru (1861–1931), a self-made wealthy barrister who belonged to the Kashmiri Pandit community,
                served twice as president of the Indian National Congress, in 1919 and 1928.
                His mother, Swarup Rani Thussu (1868–1938), who came from a well-known Kashmiri Brahmin family settled in Lahore,
                was Motilal's second wife, his first having died in childbirth. Jawaharlal was the eldest of three children.
                His elder sister, Vijaya Lakshmi, later became the first female president of the United Nations General Assembly.
                His youngest sister, Krishna Hutheesing, became a noted writer and authored several books on her brother.

            <li>
                <strong>1907</strong> -Nehru went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1907 and
                graduated with an honours degree in natural science in 1910.During this period,
                he studied politics, economics, history and literature with interest. 
                The writings of Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, John Maynard Keynes, Bertrand Russell,
                Lowes Dickinson and Meredith Townsend moulded much of his political and economic thinking.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1910</strong> - After completing his degree in 1910, Nehru moved to London and studied law at the Inner temple Inn.
                During this time, he continued to study Fabian Society scholars including Beatrice Webb.
                He was called to the Bar in 1912.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1912</strong> -After returning to India in August 1912, Nehru enrolled as an advocate of the Allahabad High Court 
                and tried to settle down as a barrister.But, unlike his father, he had very little interest in his profession and 
                relished neither the practice of law nor the company of lawyers: "Decidedly the atmosphere was not intellectually 
                stimulating and a sense of the utter insipidity of life grew upon me".
                His involvement in nationalist politics was to gradually replace his legal practice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>1912</strong> - Nehru had developed an interest in Indian politics during his time in Britain as a student
                and a barrister.Within months of his return to India in 1912, Nehru attended an annual session of the Indian 
                National Congress in Patna.[32] Congress in 1912 was the party of moderates and elites,
                and he was disconcerted by what he saw as "very much an English-knowing upper-class affair".
                Nehru doubted the effectiveness of Congress but agreed to work for the party in support of the 
                Indian civil rights movement led by Mahatma Gandhi in South Africa,[34] collecting funds for the movement in 1913.
                Later, he campaigned against indentured labour and other such discrimination faced by Indians in the British colonies.

            <li>
                <strong>1914</strong> - When World War I broke out, sympathy in India was divided. 
                Although educated Indians "by and large took a vicarious pleasure" in seeing the British rulers humbled, 
                the ruling upper classes sided with the Allies. Nehru confessed he viewed the war with mixed feelings. 
                As Frank Moraes writes, "[i]f [Nehru's] sympathy was with any country it was with France, whose culture he greatly
                admired".[36] During the war, Nehru volunteered for the St. John Ambulance and worked as one of the organisation's 
                provincial secretaries Allahabad.[32] He also spoke out against the censorship acts passed by the British government 
                in India

            <li>
                <strong>1916</strong> - Nehru married Kamala Kaul in 1916. Their only daughter Indira was born a year later in 1917. 
                Kamala gave birth to a boy in November 1924, but he lived for only a week.
